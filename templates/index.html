Cancer is a group of diseases that are defined by abnormal cell proliferation and can spread to other parts of the body.
Pancreatic cancer originates in the organ behind the lower stomach called the pancreas. The pancreas secretes digestive
enzymes as well as hormones that help regulate sugar metabolism. Pancreas cancer is usually discovered late, spreads
quickly, and has a poor prognosis. Cancer-specific symptoms may not appear until later stages, and there are no reliable
screening techniques to identify high-risk patients. The manual method of checking whether a patient has Pancreatic
cancer or not can be time-consuming and it can be tedious because it required experience in Radiologist interpretation.
One of the leading causes of cancer death is pancreatic cancer; however, if found early enough, it can be treated. To
solve this issue, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been developed, trained, and tested using Computed Tomography
(CT) scan images dataset to detect pancreatic tumors by many authors; Though ANN can learn a single feature
representation of the image, in the case of complex images such as abdominal CT image ANN will fail to give better
predictions, this is because it cannot learn pixel dependencies present in the images. The image processing technique of
Convolution Neural Network (CNN) was deployed in this work to detect the pancreatic tumor in the abdominal CT image, we
observed that it gives better accuracy of tumor detection.

NOTES
<ul>
<li>This deep learning model has been trained and validated, using a locally curated pancreatic cancer dataset from University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH) and Olaolu Hospital, Ilorin. This was made possible with the help Dr. Aremu A., a Radiologist Consultant.</li>
<li><b style="color:red;">The suitability of this deep learning model for clinical use has not been validated. Therefore it cannot be used for any clinical purpose! It can be used for research purposes and for comparison with other similar models.</b></li>
